##### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on evolutionary genomic identification of signatures of positive selection associated to resistance escalation in major malaria vectors.
Shell scripts and R scripts below described the pipeline used for the analyses of the Poolseq GWAS data.

# Alignement script


# Conversion of fractions into decimal numbers
I wrote a shell bash script that can allow anyone to convert fractions into decimal numbers for downstream analyses. In my case, i was mainly interested on Major Allele (MAA) and Minor Allele (MIA) frequencies from the PoolSeq GWAS generated using Popoolation2.

How to run the command?
- Invoke "convert_fractions.sh" script for the job.

  
`./convert_fractions.sh -i path/to/the/input/file/input.txt -o path/to/the/input/file/output.txt -c ""`

Where
- -i defined the input file
- -o defined the output file
- -c defined the columns to process separated by space (eg. "5 8 10" for conversion of column 5, column 8 and column 10).
