##### Hi there üëã üòÅ

I'm a PhD student in Cameroon.
My research currently focused on applying MultiOMICs on major malaria vectors to detect novel genetic markers and microbial signature driving widespread of insecticide super-resistance to track gene flow and developing more effective strategies for vector control, ultimately contributing to efforts to eradicate malaria. Shell, python and R scripts below described the pipeline (OMIcsTouch) used for the analyses and visualization of the Poolseq GWAS data.

## [Features](#section-1)
`OMIcsTouch` is a computational pipeline base on shell, python and R script designed to analyse Illumina Whole Genome data of any organism including *Anopheles* spp (*funestus* and *gambiae*). It performs Poolseq and Metagenomic analyses including pairwise genetic differentiation between populations, GWAS,  Meta-taxomomy, differential abundance analysis, diversity analyses, selective sweeps analyses, variant calling and annotation. The workflow can perform these analyses on illumina paired-end PoolSeq data. This pipeline combines several Bioinformatics tools available in various repository. Due to its automated scripts, this tool enables individuals who are not experts in bioinformatics to easily analyze their omics data without requiring extensive bioinformatics training. It also offers the advantage of time-saving efficiency.

Before everything. how to install the OMIcsTouch ?
To get started, simply clone the repository to your local machine or high-performance computing (HPC) environment. Then, follow the workflow carefully. Additionally, we have plans to further automate this workflow in the future by incorporating the `Snakemake` Workflow System Management (WfSM) like done for [RNA-seq-Pop](https://github.com/sanjaynagi/rna-seq-pop) that i recommend for those having RNAseq data to analyse. Thanks to @sanjaynagi for the fantastic tool.

Installtion: `git clone https://github.com/Gadji-M/Gadji-M_PoolSeq_GWAS_OMIcsTouch/`

# I. [Poolseq Genome-wide Association Study (Poolseq_GWAS) analysis pipeline](#section-3)
<a name="section-3"></a>

## 1. Quality control script using fastqc and multiqc
<a name="section-4"></a>

I am going to show here how to use the `Fastq_Quality_check.sh` script i wrote to sequentialy perform quality control of your NGS data using `fastqc` then pipe the sdout from `fastqc` into `multiqc` to aggregate the results and visualize. This command helps you to save more time and speed your analyses.
Before to start please ensure that you make the script executable using the following command `chmod +x Fastq_Quality_check.sh`.

To to that,
- invoke `Fastq_Quality_check.sh` then run this command:
  
`./Fast_Quality_check.sh -i path/to/the/folder/containing/FastQ_files -o path/to/the/output_file -t 20`

Where,
- -i represents the path to the folder where all your fastQ files are located;
- -o represents the path to the file where you want to save your results (note that if it doesn't exist, it will be automatically created);
- -t is the number of thread you want to run your job with (you can adjust according to the performance and parameters of your computer).

After the quality control done you will have in the multiqc file a html document summarizing the QC for all your samples (see example below).

![Alt Text](fastqc-status-check-heatmap-2.png)
Fig 1. Quality control of Poolseq FASTQ data. Green, yellow, and red boxes represent pass, warn, and fail qualities, respectively.

  
## 2. Alignment and statistics
<a name="section-5"></a>

The `Alignment.sh` script was written to help align samples that have 2 or more read pairs (two or more reads for forward and for reverse reads post pair-end WGS). The alignment uses `bwa mem` algorith to perform alignment and convert the sam output into bam output using samtools.
In details,
- It check the number of forward and reverse reads for each sample.
- If a sample has exactly one pair of forward and reverse reads, the standart aligment usin BWA-MEM will be run;
- If a sample has two, three, or four pairs of forward and reverse reads, it will combine all the forward reads and all the reverse reads into two separate files and then run the BWA-MEM alignment on the combined reads;
- After the alignment is complete, the combined read files will be clean;
- If a sample doesn't have the correct number of reads, a message indicating that the sample is skipped will be print.
- 
How to run the command?
- invoke `Alignment.sh`

`./alignment.sh -b /path/to/base_dir -t 60 -r /path/to/reference/genome.fasta -o /path/to/output_dir`

Where
- -b represents the base directory;
- -t is the number of threads to use for the alignment;
- -r refers to the reference genome, note that it must be indexed before running (`bwa index genome.fasta`);
- -o refers to the sorted bam output file.


### Computing mapping and coverage statistics

Here, i will show you how to quickly compute mapping and coverage statistics using picard tools and samtools. This part will use `Mapping_statistics.sh` and `Coverage_statistics.sh` shell scripts.
How to run the command line for mapping statistics?

`./Mapping_statistics.sh -b path/to/the/bam_files/directory -o path/to/the/output_directory -p /path/to/the/picard/Software/directory/ -r /path/to/the/reference/VectorBase-61_AfunestusFUMOZ_Genome.fasta`

Where,
- -b represents the file in which the aligned bam files are located;
- -o represents the file in which the output will be redirected (it will be created if it doesn't exist);
- -p represents the directory in which the picard.jar is located;
- -r represents the path to the reference genome of the organism of interest.

How to run the command line for coverage statistics ?

`./Coverage_statistics.sh -b /path/to/bam_directory -o /path/to/output_directory`

### Note: It's important to do QC check pre and post Mapping your Reads to the reference.

## 3. Sorting and marking duplicates from .bam files
<a name="section-6"></a>

Here, i will show you how to sort according to coordinates, mark and remove duplicates using picard tools with bam files as input.
This session will use the shell script `Sorting_marking_duplicates.sh`.

How to run the command line?

`./Sorting_marking_duplicates.sh -i /path/to/input_dir -o /path/to/output_dir -m metrics.txt -p /path/to/picard.jar`

Where,
- -i represents the file in which the bam files to process are into;
- -o represents the file in which the output will be redirected;
- -m represents the file in which the metric files of each bam file will be save after marking duplicates;
- -p represents the path to the tool you will use to process the sorting and deduplication (in this case, picard.jar from the Picard toold).


Where,
-  -b represents the bam files directory;
-  -o represents the output directory (it will be automatically created if it doesn't exist).

### Creation of mpileup and synchronized file
Here, we are going to create mpileup file with final bam files as input then subsequently generate a synchronized file for input in Popoolation2.
Synchronized files basically contain the allele frequencies for every population at every base in the reference genome in a concise format. Note that the synchronized file format contains the allele frequencies after filtering for base quality (see `Kofler et al., 2011`).

For that, we need first to run:
`samtools mpileup -B -Q 10 -f /path/to/reference/genome/ /path/to/bam/files/s1.bam /path/to/bam/files/s2.bam /path/to/bam/files/sn.bam > /path/to/output/files/s1_s2_sn.mpileup`

Or alternatively, you can use the script i wrote `bam2mpileup.sh` to generate the mpileup file following.

`./bam2mpileup.sh -r /path/to/reference/genome/reference.fa -o /path/to/output/files -p combined /path/to/bam/files/s1.bam /path/to/bam/files/s2.bam /path/to/bam/files/sn.bam`

Where,
- -r represents the indexed reference genome;
- -o represents the output file where the mpileup file will be stored (it is created automatically if it doesn't exist);
- -p represents the path to the bam files.

To generate synchronized file, we'll use this command from popoolation2 tutorial [popoolation2](https://sourceforge.net/p/popoolation2/wiki/Tutorial/).

`java -ea -Xmx7g -jar <popoolation2-path>/mpileup2sync.jar --input combined.mpileup --output combined_java.sync --fastq-type sanger --min-qual 10 --threads 20`


## 4. Estimation of allele frequency
<a name="section-7"></a>


### Conversion of fractions into decimal numbers
<a name="section-8"></a>

I wrote a shell script that can allow anyone to convert fractions into decimal numbers for downstream analyses. In my case, i was mainly interested on Major Allele (MAA) and Minor Allele (MIA) frequencies from the PoolSeq GWAS generated using Popoolation2.

How to run the command?
- Invoke `convert_fractions.sh` script for the job.

  
`./convert_fractions.sh -i path/to/the/input/file/input.txt -o path/to/the/input/file/output.txt -c ""`

Where
- -i defined the input file
- -o defined the output file
- -c defined the columns to process separated by space (eg. "5 8 10" for conversion of column 5, column 8 and column 10).

## 5. Population Genomic Analysis
<a name="section-9"></a>

The aim of this part is to detect regions of genomic/genetic differentiation across the genome of several populations (in our case Anopheles populations). For that, we are going to estimate pairwise FST genetic differentiation values using a custom script (`Fst_Sliding_windows.sh`) we wrote to facilitate windows analyses and base on [popoolation2](https://sourceforge.net/p/popoolation2/wiki/Tutorial/). It computes pairwise FST values across specified window and step sizes, with results saved according to individual window in unique output file. Informative progress messages ensure user guidance. This tool automates FST calculations, making it accessible and efficient for population genetics research, providing flexibility in parameter configurations and simplifying complex genetic analyses.

How to run the command ?
Invoke, Fst_sliding_windows.sh and run:

`./Fst_sliding_windows.sh -i path/to/sync/file.sync -o path/to/output -c 2 -C 10 -f "5%" -w "500,1000,2000" -s "250,500,1000" -p 40 -P "/mnt/46TB/Ghost/Space_Gadji/PoolSeq_2022/software/popoolation2_1201/" -F 0.2`

Where,

- -i represents the input sync file, (Please double-check that the path to the sync file is correct, and the file exists at that location);

- -o represents the output directory where the results will be stored (If it doesn't exist, it will be automatically created);

- -c represents the minimum count of alleles required to consider a site in the analysis (It should be a valid value);

- -C represents the minimum coverage required for a site to be included in the analysis, (Make sure it's a valid value and appropriate for your data);

- -f represents the maximum coverage as a percentage or a value of the total coverage;
The maximum coverage; All populations are required to have coverages, lower or equal than the maximum coverage;
The maximum coverage may be provided as one of the following:

         500 a maximum coverage of 500 will be used for all populations
         300,400,500 a maximum coverage of 300 will be used for the first population, a maximum coverage of 400 for the second population and so on
         5% the 5% highest coverages will be ignored, this value is independently estimated for every population

- -w represents a comma-separated list of window sizes, (ensure that the sizes are correctly formatted and separated by commas, eg. "500000,250000,100000");

- -s represents a comma-separated list of step sizes, (double-check the formatting and values, eg. "250000,125000,50000");

- -p  This sets the pool size of each sample paramete (the number of pools has to fit with the number of populations provided in the file);
-p 500 means that all populations have a pool size of 500
-p 500:300:600 means that the first population has a pool size of 500, the seccond of 300 and the third 600;

- -P represents the path to the Popoolation2 software;

- -F represents the min_covered_fraction value, (the minimum fraction of a window being between min-coverage and
        max-coverage in ALL populations);

Alternatively, you can run the Fst calculation for each locus and use [WindowScanR](https://github.com/tavareshugo/WindowScanR) in R platform for Windows analyses.
When the Job is done, please run this command line to covert and format the fst files into readeable file by R for plotting.

`perl path/to/popoolation2_1201/export/pwc2igv.pl --input path/to/fst/files --output path/to/output/`

Once you have finished with the pairwise Fst computation, you can use the `Fst_plot.R` script i wrote to visualize your output and analyse differentiated regions.
You will have a plot like below wrapped according to chromosome. üòÅ üòÅ
![Alt Text](Fst_plot.png)
Fig 2. Pairwise Fst plot between two divergent populations. The strong signal observed on 1 suggests a major region of genetic differentiation between the two populations. 
Futher analysis should target this region of interest using fine-scale mapping to detect major allele driving the trait of interest.
Woooooowwwwww, we've achieved a great job so far üòåüòåüòåüòå.

## 6. Detection of evidence of Selective Sweeps
<a name="section-10"></a>

The aim of this section is to learn how to detect evidence of positive selection among different populations. For that, we are going to estimate Tajima's D parameter which could tell us about the state of selection in populations then estimate as well the genetic diversity by the mean of theta pi and theta watterson. To facilitate the calculations, we wrote an automated script based on [grenedalf](https://github.com/lczech/grenedalf) that iterates through each BAM file, creates output directories, and runs grendalf with specified window sizes and strides. It organizes results in separate directories, making analysis efficient and organized. Users execute the script by providing necessary options, enabling streamlined genomic data analysis. The beauty of this script is that it could consecutively process different window sizes and strides, then store each output in his own file.
How to run the job?
invoke `diversity_measure.sh` and run:

`./scripts/diversity_measure.sh -p path/to/grenedalf -d path/to/bam/files/directory -w "25000 50000 250000 500000" -s "12500 25000 125000 250000" -o path/to/output/directory -M 5 -S 5 -Q intersection -q 2 -L 4 -C 10 -c 1000 -F all -f comma -m nan -z popoolation-corrected-tajimas-d -n 80 -t path/to/log/diversity.log -T sliding`

Where,

- -p represents the path to the grendalf executable (make sure you have install grenedalf);

- -d represents the directory containing input BAM files for genomic analysis.

- -w Defines window sizes (in base pairs) for analysis. For example, four window sizes could be provided: 25,000; 50,000; 250,000; and 500,000;

- -s defines window sliding strides (in base pairs) corresponding to the window sizes;

- -o represents the directory where the output of the analysis will be stored;

- -M represents the minimum mapping quality threshold for reads in the BAM files to be included in the analysis;

- -S represents the minimum base quality threshold for reads to be included;

- -Q defines the method for selecting loci. could be "union" or "intersection";

- -q represents the minimum count of samples required for a locus to be included;

- -L represents the maximum count of samples allowed for a locus to be included;

- -C represents the minimum coverage depth required for a locus to be included;

- -c represents the maximum coverage depth allowed for a locus to be included;

- -F Defines the type of diversity measure to compute. It could be one of these measures {theta-pi,theta-watterson,tajimas-d}=all or "all," which likely means computing all available diversity measures;

- -f  Specifies the separator character used in output files, it could be one of these {comma,tab,space,semicolon}, its used comma by default; 

- -m Sets the value used for missing data entries in the output, (e.g., resulting from positions with no counts, or windows with no variants). This is useful to match formatting expectations of downstream software;

- -z Specifies an option or value for the analysis, related to Tajima's D calculations (popoolation-corrected-tajimas-d);

- -n Specifies the number of threads or CPU cores to be used for parallel processing;

- -t specifies the path for the log file where information about the analysis progress will be recorded.

- -T specifies the type of window to use for analysis, it could be on of these (sliding,queue,single,regions,chromosomes,genome);


## 7. Variants calling and annotation
<a name="section-11"></a>

This section will focus on detecting and annotating variants (SNPs/Indels) using PoolSeq data. We are going to use [VarScan](https://varscan.sourceforge.net/using-varscan.html#v2.3_mpileup2cns) for that. [VarScan](https://varscan.sourceforge.net/using-varscan.html#v2.3_mpileup2cns) is a command line-based tools for variant calling and its written  in Java programming language. It employs heuristic and statistic thresholds based on user-defined criteria to call variants using SAMtools mpileup data as input. It is therefore designed to detect SNPs/indels in individual and pooled samples [Koboldt et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4278659/). 
You need to download the latest version of VarScan to run the variant calling job. For more informations, please visit the documentation [VarScan](https://varscan.sourceforge.net/using-varscan.html#v2.3_mpileup2cns). 
How to run the SNPs/indels calling?
In our case we ran it directly on bam files by reading the STDIN (standard input) bam files into samtools mpileup and pipe the output in java -jar mpileup2indel for indels calling or java -jar mpileup2snp for SNPs calling. Our command looks like this:
### Variant calling
#### For Indels calling:
`samtools mpileup -Q 10 -q 10 -B -f /path/to/reference/VectorBase-61_AfunestusFUMOZ_Genome.fasta -b /path/to/bam_files/bam_files_list.txt  |  java -jar /path/to/varscan/VarScan.v2.3.9.jar mpileup2indel --min-coverage 10 --min-reads2 4 --min-avg-qual 10 --min-var-freq 0.01 --min-freq-for-hom 0.75 --p-value 0.05 --output-vcf 1 > /path/to/output/filename.Indels_calling.vcf`

#### For SNPs calling:
`samtools mpileup -Q 10 -q 10 -B -f /path/to/reference/VectorBase-61_AfunestusFUMOZ_Genome.fasta -b /path/to/bam_files/bam_files_list.txt  |  java -jar /path/to/varscan/VarScan.v2.3.9.jar mpileup2snp --min-coverage 10 --min-reads2 4 --min-avg-qual 10 --min-var-freq 0.01 --min-freq-for-hom 0.75 --p-value 0.05 --output-vcf 1 > /path/to/output/vcf/filename.SNPs_calling.vcf`
Where:
- --min-coverage represents the Minimum read depth at a position to make a call;
- --min-reads2 represents the Minimum supporting reads at a position to call variants;
- --min-avg-qual represents the Minimum base quality at a position to count a read;
- --min-var-freq represents the Minimum variant allele frequency threshold;
- --p-value represents the Default p-value threshold for calling variants.

For `pooled samples`, It is preferable to specify higher minimum coverage but lower variant allele frequency thresholds (10 and 0.01 in our case for example). 
For detection and validation of Indels, Structural variants, duplications, inversions, please visualize you final alignment bam files using alingment viewer like [IGV](https://igv.org) which i recommend. Don't hesitate to go throught the documentation to learn how to detect those genetic variations.

### Variant annotation
After calling the variants using [VarScan](https://varscan.sourceforge.net/using-varscan.html#v2.3_mpileup2cns), we annotated them using [SnpEff](http://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/) which is a bioinformatics tool used for annotating and predicting the effects of genomic/genetic variations, particularly SNPs and indels, on genomic elements, genes, and proteins. It is quite simple to run and widely used in genomics and genetics research to interpret the functional consequences of genetic variants and is particularly valuable for understanding the impact of variations in coding regions of genes. It guides you on which genes to focus for further analyses.
[SnpEff](http://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/) takes genetic variants in various formats (VCF in our case) as input and annotates them by identifying their locations within the genome and determining their functional impacts. It classifies variants as synonymous, non-synonymous, missense, frameshift, stop-gain, and many other categories based on their impact on genes and proteins. To run the variant annotation and prediction, you need to build a database according to the organism on which you are working. For that, please visit the documentation [SnpEff](http://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/).
How to run SnfEff ?

`java -Xmx8g -jar SnpEff.jar output.vcf Organism.Database > output.annotated.vcf`

At the end of the job, you can use [SnpSift](http://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/snpsift/introduction/)to extract your fields of interest for further analyses.


# II. [Metagenomic analysis pipeline](#section-1)
<a name="section-12"></a>

## 1. Extraction of unmapped reads for Metagenomic analyses (EUMA)
<a name="section-13"></a>

I am going to show you how to perform metagenomic analyses using unmapped reads from WGS with the aim to identify microbial signature that could be potentially associated to insecticide super-resistance in malaria vectors.
During the WGS of malaria vectors, beside the entire genome that will be sequenced, other organisms genomes present in the sample are also sequenced. This involved bacteria, parasites, Eukaryotes, Viruses, funga and even unknown organisms refer as `dark reads` that will need further investigation to discover new species using De Novo assembly for example.
We are going to use here the script `Extract_unmapped_reads.sh` to retrieve unmapped reads from bam files then convert them into fastq files.
How to run the command?
- invoke `Extract_unmapped_reads.sh` and run

`./Extract_unmaped.sh -i /path/to/input_directory -o /path/to/input_directory/Unmapped_reads -t 20`

Where
- -i represents the input directory containing all the bam files;
- -o represents the output directory where to store all the unmapped reads for each sample;
- -t represents the number of threads for parallel processing (it depend on your computer capacity).

## 2. Generation of forward and reverse reads (R1 and R2) from a paired fastq file
<a name="section-14"></a>

Here we are going to generate the forward and the reverse reads from a single paired fastq file using `Seqtk` which is a command-line tool for processing sequences in various file formats, such as FASTA and FASTQ. It is often used in bioinformatics and genomics research for tasks like subsetting, converting between formats, and generating random sequences. Seqtk is a versatile and efficient tool that can be a valuable addition to your bioinformatics toolkit.
For that, we are going to use the `Separate_fastq_reads.sh` shell script with fastq files as input.
How to run the command ?
- invoke `Separate_fastq_reads.sh` and run

 `./Separate_fastq_reads.sh -i /path/to/input_directory -o /path/to/output_directory -t 10`

 Where
 - -i represents the input directory containing all the fastq files;
 - -o represents the output directory where to store all the forward (R1) and reverse (R2) for each sample;
 - -t represents the number of threads for parallel processing (it depend on your computer capacity).

## 3. Metagemome Assembly
<a name="section-15"></a>
Here we are going to generate contigs base on forward (R1) and reverse reads (R2) generated above. This is called assembly which involves reconstructing the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome or a specific genomic region from short DNA fragments or reads. 
These reads are typically generated through DNA sequencing technologies. The assembly process aims to piece together these reads in the correct order and orientation to create a contiguous representation of the original DNA sequence. 
`MEGAHIT` will help us to do the job but we have render that very simple for none bioinformaticians by providing a bash script `assembly_script.sh` that could be run in just one single command line to process hunders of different samples.
This Bash script automates the assembly of paired-end sequencing data using `Megahit`. It supports both `.fastq` and `.fastq.gz` files. Users will just need to provide input and output directories, and optionally, the number of threads. 
It searches for paired-end files, creates output directories, and processes each sample separately. For each sample, it checks if the reverse read exists in either format, runs `Megahit` accordingly. The script is a versatile tool for batch processing paired-end sequencing data, ensuring compatibility with compressed and uncompressed formats while handling missing reverse reads.

How to run the script ?
Invoke `assembly_script.sh` and run:

`./assembly_script.sh -i Path/to/fastq/files/ -o Path/to/the/output/directory/ -t 10`

Where
- -i represents the input directory containing the fastq files;
- -o represents the output directory where to stored the assembled contigs in fasta format (note that if it doesn't exist, it will be automatically created);
- -t represents the number of threads for parallel processing (it depend on your computer capacity).


## 4. Microbial Classification using unmapped reads via Kraken2 (MCUUR)
<a name="section-16"></a>

Here, i am going to show you how to assess the microbial contribution in our sample.
To remind, what i did was to remove host genome (Anopheles funestus) by mapping to the AfunF3 genome avalaible on vectorbase.org then now i'm going to use the non-host reads to characterize microbial composition.
For this job, i'm going to use `kraken2` which is a taxonomic sequence classifier that assigns taxonomic labels to DNA sequences. Kraken examines the k-mers within a query sequence and uses the information within those k-mers to query a database. That database maps k-mers to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes known to contain a given k-mer. To run the classification, you need to download the kraken2 database or build it in your computer.
A Kraken 2 database is a directory containing at least 3 files:

- `hash.k2d`: Contains the minimizer to taxon mappings;
- `opts.k2d`: Contains information about the options used to build the database; 
- `taxo.k2d`: Contains taxonomy information used to build the database.

Once you have the database to which you will classify your reads, you can:
- invoke `Kraken2_classification.sh` and run

`./Kraken2_classification.sh -i /path/to/fastq_directory -d /path/to/kraken_database -o /path/to/output_directory -u /path/to/unclassified_directory -c /path/to/classified_directory -t 50`

Where
- -i represents the input directory containing paired fastq files;
- -d represents the kraken2 database to which you want to classify your reads;
- -o represents the output directory where the classification reports will be stored (The directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist);
- -u represents the directory where the unclassified sequences will be stored (The directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist);
- -c represents the directory where the classified sequences will be stored (The directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist);

## 5. Converting fastq to fasta files
<a name="section-17"></a>

Here i'll show how to convert fastq files into fasta files for downstream analyses like phylogenetic analysis. 
We are going to use the `fastq2fasta_file.sh` script here. The conversion is done via `awk` which is a versatile and powerful text-processing tool commonly used in Unix-like operating systems. 
It is primarily used for searching, extracting, and manipulating text data within files, making it a popular choice for tasks like data transformation, data analysis, and report generation.
How to run the command?
- invoke `fastq2fasta_file.sh` and run

`./fastq2fasta_file.sh -i input_directory -o output_directory -t 10`

Where
- -i represents the input directory containing the fastq files;
- -o represents the output directory where the fasta files will be stored (The directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist);
- -t represents the number of threads to use for parallel processing (it depends of your computer capacity).


## 6. Extraction of candidate bacteria taxa
<a name="section-18"></a>

Here, i am going to show how to extract bacteria sequences of interest using a python3 script i wrote based on the taxid generated post-kraken2 classification.
What we want to do is to extract all the most abundant bacteria sequence reads in our various samples. Remember when we did microbial classification using the `Kraken2_classification.sh` script, we generated an output file containing classified sequences.
We are now going to extract the most abundant sequences of interest for subsequent analyses.
For that, we are going to use the `Extract_sequences_taxid.py` script.
How to run the command?
- invoke `Extract_sequences_taxid.py` and run

 `python3 Extract_sequences.py -i input.fasta -o output.fasta -l id_list.txt`

 Where
 - -i represents the input file in fasta format where sequences will be extracted based on list of taxid;
 - -o represents the output file containing the extracted sequences of interest;
 - -l represents the list of taxid of all the bacteria taxa to be extracted.


Alternatively, you can use this simple command line to extract sequences of interest.

`grep -A 1 "kraken:taxid|idnumber" your_input.fasta | grep -v "^--$" > extracted_sequences.fasta`

## 7. Microbial diversity analysis
<a name="section-19"></a>

Microbial diversity analysis involves studying the alpha diversity which is a measure that quantifies the diversity of species within a specific environment. It measures the number of species (species richness) and their relative abundance (species evenness) in a single community or sample and  beta diversity refers as between-sample/population or between-site diversity, quantifies the differences in species composition (species identities) and relative abundances between different locations or habitats.

Common metrics for alpha diversity include species richness (the count of unique species) and indices like the Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's diversity index, which take into account both species richness and evenness.
##### Note: Alpha diversity provides information about the diversity within a particular population or sample and is used to answer questions like "How many different species are present in a given area?" whereas Beta diversity is concerned with the variation in species composition and the turnover of species across different sites. It helps answer questions like "How do species assemblages change as you move from one habitat to another?".

To calculate alpha and beta-diversity measures, we processed the `kraken.reports` files by filtering and aggregating them to create tables. These tables were subsequently used as input data in [Phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/), and any features associated with control samples (H2O and C2H5OH) were removed during the filtering process, thanks to [decontam](https://benjjneb.github.io/decontam/vignettes/decontam_intro.html/) for that.

#### Alpha-diversity estimation
After creating our Phyloseq class object, alpha diversity was calculated and plotted using the below commands:
This line calculates alpha diversity measures using the `estimate_richness` phyloseq function. The results are stored in the object alpha_diversity. The diversity measures being calculated here are Chao1, ACE, Shannon, Simpson and Fisher diversity indexes.
`alpha_diversity <- estimate_richness(Phyloseq_class_object)`

In this line, the Shannon's diversity index (alpha diversity) values are extracted from the alpha_diversity object and converted into a data frame. The resulting data frame is stored back in the variable alpha_diversity.
`alpha_diversity<-as.data.frame(alpha_diversity$Shannon)` 

This line extracts the "population" information from the sample data associated with the Phyloseq_class_object data frame. The extracted population information is converted into a factor variable and stored in the object groups. This is typically used to define groups or categories for further analysis.
`groups <- factor(sample_data(Phyloseq_class_object)$population)`

Here, a new data frame named alpha_df is created. It contains two columns: "Alpha," which holds the alpha diversity values (Shannon's index), and "Group," which holds the group (population) information for each sample necessary visualization.
`alpha_df <- data.frame(Alpha = alpha_diversity, Group = groups)`

Now we can display our plot.
The ggplot2 function below was used for plotting:

`shannon_box<-ggplot(alpha_diversity,
                    aes(x=concentration,
                        y=Shannon,
                        fill=phenotype)) + geom_boxplot()+
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(size = 22, face = "bold"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 22, face = "bold"),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 18),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 25, face = "bold"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 30, face = "bold"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 22),  # Set the legend text size
        legend.title = element_text(size = 25, face = "bold"))  # Set the legend title size)#makestitlessmaller`

print(shannon_box) # To display the box plot.

We then look at the difference in the microbial composition between each group by applying a pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test as we had more than two groups to compare.
The function `pairwise_result <- pairwise.wilcox.test(alpha_df$alpha_diversity.Shannon, alpha_df$Group, p.adjust.method = "fdr")` was used for that.
This function is used to compare groups for significant differences and applies the Wilcoxon rank sum test (also known as the Mann-Whitney U test) between pairs of groups. The p.adjust.method argument allows to adjust or correct p-values for multiple comparisons. In this case, "fdr" indicates the method to control the false discovery rate.

#### Beta-diversity estimation
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance matrix was calculated and plot in non-metric multidimensional scaling  (NMDS) using the functions `distance()` and  `ordinate` and `plot_ordination` from phyloseq package.
NMDS is a dimensionality reduction technique often used for visualizing and exploring dissimilarity or distance data in a reduced-dimensional space.

#Calculate Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distance matrix
`distance_matrix <- phyloseq::distance(phyloseq_class_object, method = "bray")`

#Perform non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) on Phyloseq class object
`data.ord <- ordinate(phyloseq_class_object, "NMDS", "bray")`

#Plot dissimilarity based on NMDS
`plot_ordination(phyloseq_class_object, data.ord, color="population", shape="phenotype", 
  title="NMDS Plot" ) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 22, face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 22, face = "bold"),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
    strip.text = element_text(size = 25, face = "bold"),
    strip.background = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 30, face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 30, face = "bold"),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 22), 
    legend.title = element_text(size = 25, face = "bold")
  ) + 
  geom_point(size = 10) +
  geom_text(aes(label = population), size = 5,nudge_x = -0.005,  nudge_y = 0.020)  # Increase the size of text labels on points`

It's left now to perform a test to assess the impact of insecticide exposure on our different phenotypes. To do that, adonis2 function, typically found in the vegan package in R was used to perform a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) on a distance matrix.

`result_adonis <- adonis2(distance_matrix ~ population , data = sample_metadata, permutations = 999, method = "bray-curtis")`

The result_adonis object will contain the results of the PERMANOVA analysis, including statistics and p-values, which can be used to assess whether there are significant differences in multivariate dispersion among the different phenotypes/populations. This analysis is useful for testing the effect of phenotype or population on the data while accounting for multivariate variation.

## 8. Microbial differential abundance analysis
<a name="section-20"></a>
Differential abundance analyses were done using [DEseq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html) and validated using [ANCOM-BC2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ANCOMBC/inst/doc/ANCOMBC2.html).
DESeq2 is a powerful R/Bioconductor package for differential abundance analysis of count data, including microbiome data. It's a popular choice for analyzing microbial differential abundance in microbiome studies. 
Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction 2 (ANCOM-BC2) is a methodology for performing differential abundance (DA) analysis of microbiome count data. This version extends and refines the previously published Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes with Bias Correction .
#### Note: For differential abundance analysis, taxa representing at least 1% of the overall obundance were used. These taxa constitute the top abundant taxa in our sample pools.

The function  `phyloseq_to_deseq2()` was invoked to convert the phyloseq class object into deseq2 object before processing. This function is key because it does all the complicated DESeq2 work.

The following two lines actually do all the complicated DESeq2 work. The first line converts your phyloseq-format microbiome data into a DESeqDataSet with dispersions estimated, using the experimental design formula, also shown (the ~phenotype in our case). The DESeq function (second line) does the rest of the testing, in this case with default testing framework, but you can actually use alternatives.

`diagdds = phyloseq_to_deseq2(phyloseq_class_object, ~phenotype)`
`diagdds = DESeq(diagdds, test="Wald", fitType="parametric")`

The following results function call creates a table of the results of the tests. Very fast. I then filtered the adjusted p-value less than the defined threshold alpha=5%. The rest of this example is just formatting the results table with taxonomic information for nice visualization.

`res = results(diagdds, cooksCutoff = FALSE)
alpha = 0.05
sigtab = res[which(res$padj < alpha), ]
sigtab = cbind(as(sigtab, "data.frame"), as(tax_table(Phyloseq_class_object)[rownames(sigtab), ], "matrix"))`

`write.table(sigtab, "filename.txt", sep = "\t", dec = ".", row.names = T)`

ANCOM-BC2 was then run to validate the findings obtained from DESeq2 using the command bellow:

`ancombc2_results <- ancombc2(phyloseq_class_object, tax_level = "Species",
                             group = "phenotype", prv_cut = 0.10,
                             alpha = 0.05, fix_formula = "population" + "phenotype",
                            p_adj_method = "fdr",
                            verbose = T,
                            n_cl = 5, global = FALSE, pairwise = TRUE, 
                            dunnet = FALSE, trend = FALSE)  # Adjust parameters as needed`

#### Note: Please go throught [DEseq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html) and [ANCOM-BC2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ANCOMBC/inst/doc/ANCOMBC2.html) documentations for more details on how to run the commands.
